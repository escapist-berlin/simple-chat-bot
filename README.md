# Simple Chat Bot (Kotlin)

This is my first Kotlin project, built as part of the Hyperskill learning path.  
It's a simple **console-based chatbot** that interacts with the user using basic Kotlin concepts like variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

## ðŸ’¡ About the Project

The chatbot introduces itself, guesses your age based on a math trick, counts from 0 to any number, and even quizzes you with a multiple-choice question.

The goal of the project is to help beginners get comfortable with:
- Basic Kotlin syntax
- String and number handling
- Control flow: `if`, `when`, `for` loops
- Writing and organizing simple functions
- Building a console app with a logical structure
